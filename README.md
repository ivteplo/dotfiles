# dotfiles
This is a repository which contains my configuration files for different apps.

## .vimrc
`.vimrc` uses a plugin `VimPlug` to manage the extensions for Vim. 

[How to install `VimPlug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation)

When first opened the vim, run: `:PlugInstall`. When the installation ended, restart the Vim.

## .bashrc
`.bashrc` contains only my custom settings (no bash defaults), so you can append them at the end of your bashrc.
